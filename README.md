# Arduino-Test
 This Arduino sketch initializes several digital pins as outputs, including the built-in LED pin and pins 7 through 13. In the main loop, it iterates through pins 13 to 7 in reverse order, turning each pin on for 500 milliseconds and then off before moving to the next pin. After cycling through all the specified pins, it pauses for 1 second before starting the loop again. This code effectively creates a cascading LED effect, where each LED turns on and off sequentially from pin 13 down to pin 7. It's a simple yet visually engaging demonstration of controlling multiple LEDs using Arduino.
